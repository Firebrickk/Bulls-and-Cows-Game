# Bulls-and-Cows-Game
In this game you need to guess the code made by the computer. 
Before starting the game, you can choose the length of the code and the number of characters. 
Each time you enter the code, you get the result - the number of "cows" and "bulls". 
"Cow" means that you guessed the symbol, and "bull" means that you guessed not only the symbol but also its position in the code.
